#Version notes:
> 1. The learning rate need to adjust according to the size of problem. Larger problem requires smaller learning rate.
> 2. Testing pass: small, medium and large networks, and mimo (multiple inputs and multiple outputs) network.
> 3. Units: INPUT, FULL, SOFTMAX.
> 4. Extra: CONV forward pass. Network topology refinement.
