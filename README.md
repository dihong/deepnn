# Deep Neural Networks Implementation with OpenCL
The development of neural networks now becomes hassle-free. The neural networks designer provides a user-friendly tool for designing neural networks of various structures, activation functions, loss functions, and more. You create network models, we generate codes for you to train the models. The codes are optimized for GPU computing, compatible with GPUs from different vendors (e.g. AMD and Nvidia). The trained models can be easily embedded into C++, Python, Matlab, and Java programs.

# Features
> 1. User friendly visual design interface.
> 2. Implemented with OpenCL language, so it supports a variety of devices ranging from CPU to GPU of both AMD and Nvidia.
